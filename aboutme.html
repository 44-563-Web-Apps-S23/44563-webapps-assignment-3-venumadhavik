        <p1>Reading reduces stress.Reading about something you enjoy or losing yourself in a good novel is an excellent way to relax. 
            It can ease tension in your muscles and heart while letting your brain wander to new ideas and live in someone else's shoes. 
            Reading is a mini vacation for your brain!</p1>
